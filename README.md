formulas
========


## Summary
Collection of concise formulas for standard development tasks.

## Intent
Frameworks and Libraries are great, but sometimes you just cannot integrate them for one reason or another. When you need to write a specific component by yourself, formulars gives you an overview about what you *must* consider (essentials), what you *should* consider (recommendations) and what you *could* consider (options). 

When you write your own library, formulas wants to enable you to do so quicker and more complete. Sometimes all you have to do is to rewrite the example codes to match your application architecture.

## Audience
formulas has a strong focus on web development in the PHP ecosystem, but encourages programming language agnostic explanations. However, example implementations may be in a specific language or pseudo code.
