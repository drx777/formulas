formulas
========

## Summary
Collection of concise formulas for standard development tasks.

## Intent
Frameworks and Libraries are great, but sometimes you just cannot integrate them for one reason or another. When you need to write a specific component by yourself, formulars gives you an overview about what you *must* consider (essentials), what you *should* consider (recommendations) and what you *could* consider (options). 

When you write your own library, formulas wants to enable you to do so quicker and more complete. Sometimes all you have to do is to rewrite the example codes to match your application architecture.

## Audience
formulas has a strong focus on web development in the PHP ecosystem, but encourages programming language agnostic explanations. However, example implementations may be in a specific language or pseudo code. Also, examination and comparison of existing implementations may help deciding whether a custom implementation is even required.

## What it's not
formulas is no collection of code snippets nor a collection of libraries.  Think of it as various construction instructions with an attached market overview of existing solutions. There is no (well, almost) code here, especially no full fledged drop-in components. This is only documentation.

## Status
There are no formulas here. Your participation is welcome. See [TODO.md](http://github.com/drx777/formulas/blob/master/TODO.md) for possible formulas.
